# workout-tracker

## Description
This workout tracker application keeps track of the user's workout using MongoDB. The user can create a new workout so that they can add cardio and resistance exercises to it with the relevant data. The user can navigate to '/stats' page to visualize their workouts in chart form.

I was provided with the front-end code. I created the schema via Mongoose and handle routes with Express. 

**Note** There are a few bugs on this currently with the data not displaying correctly.
